# Web-Scrapping
This is a code to extract billions of free images form internet. 

So there is a website called prnt.sc which contains more than a billion images from different source. This site allow user to easilly upload the images through different sources as web interface and screen capture tools. They are freely available to download.

The amount of images provided on the website can be really usefull, specially for someone working with images, ML, DL, or AI. This collection is a very intresting because the images randomly scattered thete is no structure in them. There ia a great difference in image to image. Simply we can say that its the treasure for developers, just we need to extract it.

I developed a tool to extract images from this site so it can be used by developers.
